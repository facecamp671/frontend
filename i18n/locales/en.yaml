  I bathe bi-monthly and am allergic to fresh air and direct sun exposure.
  I have a mental illness called "I can't handle losing".
  
  
  I have about 1k hours in dbd and try to win by any means necessary. This includes camping, tunelling, slugging, NOED
  and other 'toxic' strategies.

  I always play for fun.
  Winning = dopamine for me.
  I don't care if you're having fun or not, that's your problem.
  You 100% don't give a shit whether I'm having fun or not when you, bitch, once again use your stinking Autohaven or Eyrie map offering.
  Why should I care whether you, critter, are having fun or not?
  
  I always assume that the survivor is a toxic piece of shit until proven otherwise.
  Most survivors don't give a shit about the mood of the killers, on the contrary, they actively mock them.
  So I generally have no respect for survivors and see no reason to change my behavior.
  
  I never let survivors go just on principle. You can shove your items up your ass.
  
  I never give up or disconnect from the game unless I have to play against cheaters, bug abusers or i get distracted IRL. I consider bug users to be cheaters and report them accordingly, I don't give a shit.
  
  No mercy for TTVs, SWFs and "pro" players.
  They make the game, which is already unfairly survivor-sided, even more difficult for killers.
  Against such people, I always use Sacrificial Ward or Mori.
  
  Don't be surprised by 4-minute nap on the ground if you used map offering, Flashbangs or Saboteurs.
  The same applies to the so-called bully squads.
  You are wasting my time, I am wasting yours. Am I toxic? You're one to talk.
  
  If I managed to slug the whole team, I will not pick you up to avoid 4%, as well as your stinking perks.
  You are welcome to press the Disconnect button and go next.
  If you can't, that's your problem. If you don't like it, [tell me about it here](/salt)
  
  Don't be surprised by my meticulous movements after the game if you were gloatingly tbagging, pointing at me, waving at me, intentionally standing still, using Scene Partner or otherwise demonstrating your lack of culture and disrespect for me.
  If you, scum, don't respect me, why the hell should I show you any respect? In your language: Those who are not with us are under us. [Tell me later, did you like it when YOU are disrespected?](/salt)
  
  If after the game you call me a dumb loser (especially on an easy map for survivors), then you automatically confirm that you are so bad that
  even dumb losers can easily defeat you. This is elementary logic. Get into the habit of thinking before you shit in the chat. Accept it and go next, and don't show me in the chat what an impudent idiot you are. [There is a separate page for your verbal diarrhea](/salt)
  
  "Pro" players who secretly deboost or smurf, especially biowaste who try to farm content from newbies (streamers / tiktokers, etc.) are the main scum in the DBD community.
  People like you will leave my lobby only with a report for Unsportsmanlike Conduct. For several such reports, you are facing a ban for a couple of days, that's where you belong. TikTokers and Arabs get a report even if they behaved adequately, you are all the same.
  
  I have had many games with (legit) cheaters.
  If you fall under one of my rules of thumb, you WILL get a report from me for cheating, even if you think I don't have any hard evidence to suggest you're using them.
  The developers will figure out who's right.
  I regularly get messages from BHVR that they've taken action on my reports, so I have every reason to believe that my methods for identifying cheaters work like a charm.

  **U mad?** Don't play solo queue, dumbass
  
  **U mad about camping?** Trade hooks with a hooked survivor when he's about to reach stage 2, use Reassurance + DO GENS
  
  **U mad about tunnelling?** EVERYONE MUST USE DECISIVE STRIKE (MANDATORY) + Off the Record / Dead Hard / Blood Rush with Sprint (optional), try blinding and sandbagging the killer, try sabotaging hooks etc. + DO THE FUCKING GENS
  
  **U mad about slugging?** Use Unbreakable / Boon: Exponential / We Are Gonna Live Forever / Buckle Up / Medkit with Syringe + AT LEAST SIT DOWN AND TOUCH A FUCKING GEN???
  
  **U mad about all of the above at 5 gens?** Apparently you play so badly that I can afford to do this. Has that thought ever occurred to you? Why doesn't anyone try to repair different gens?
  
  **U mad about impossible 3gen?** Why do you fix the safest generators FIRST? Do you know that you need to fix the 3 most dangerous generators first (they are usually the central ones), and only then sit and fix the save ones?
  I recommend turning on your brain every time you get a QTE.
  
  **U mad about map?** Use map offering or Sacrificial ward
  
  **U mad about NOED?** Why did you even think that M1 killer won't have it? They all use it, why are you surprised???
  
  **U mad about Enduring and Spirit Fury?** Predrop pallets? Or you have been dropping them on my head every time like a fucking bot? Even bots don't do that, you know? Then why are you surprised???
  
  **U mad about stealth?** I recommend installing Discord, they say it helps
  
  **U mad about Legion's iri button?** Have you tried making at least one loop around each pallet? Or are you camping them like a livestock?
  Maybe you also wave your hand every time after you stun a killer? Did I Guess? You know for sure that I don't have Bamboozle, have you ever tried to run to Killer Shack, Main or T-L loops?
  
  **U mad about Legion?** Only complete noobs get mad about Legion. He's a simple M1 killer. If you also consider Bubba imbalanced, then you are definitely a noob.
  Have you 99%-ed your mending every time? Have your team grouped up in one place? Did they scatter in different directions? By the way, keep healing against Legion, it really helps us win games.
  
  **U mad about Twins?** Did you try to stay healthy? Did you immediately drop Victor or waited for me to take him down myself? Did you have at least 1 totem or Unbreakable?
  
  **U mad about Trickster?** And have you tried running to loops with high walls? Or you mindlessly ran to the first loop you came across every time? Maybe you used RPD map offering and now you're acting surprised? Maybe you tried to unhook right next to me? IN THE BASEMENT? TRY DOING IT RIGHT NEXT TO CANNIBAL TOO, YOU IDIOT.
  
  **Lost on Springwood, which you put up yourself?** You're a disgustingly dumb individual, I advise you to play with bots or delete this game from your computer
  
  **Escaped through a hatch and think you've won?**
  Congratulations, your team is dead btw.
  [Escaping through the hatch doesn't change your rating](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Skill-Based_Matchmaking_Rating#:~:text=Escaping%20through%20the%20Hatch,is%20considered%20a%20draw), so you won a whole lot of nothing.
  [And 3 kills counts as a win for killer's rating.](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Skill-Based_Matchmaking_Rating#:~:text=Killing%203%20or%204%20Survivors%20is%20considered%20a%20win%20towards%20MMR)
  Even if you all bleed out, [I still win](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Skill-Based_Matchmaking_Rating#:~:text=and%20does%20not%20care%20how%20that%20death%20occurred).
  I don't care about BP, Mori, achievements and other bullshit.
  I don't care about -3 or -4, I just want to win.
  
  **You beat me and are showing me what a fucking idiot you are?** Congratulations, fucking stepson of Azarov, you did it. You jumped from
  pallet to pallet to window to pallet to window with a pallet. It must be very hard to win on a very balancedâ„¢ map where you can always reach a pallet, right?
