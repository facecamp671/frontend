    My name is FaceCamp671 aka Alex. Least toxic 16 y.o. russian DBD streamer.
    I never leave my cave to avoid grass.
    I bathe bi-monthly and am allergic to fresh air and direct sun exposure.
    I have a mental illness called "I can't handle losing".
  </p>
  <p>
    I have about 1k hours in dbd and try to win by any means necessary. This includes camping, tunelling, slugging, NOED
    and other 'toxic' strategies.
