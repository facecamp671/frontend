    I'm always playing for fun. Winning = Fun for me. I don't care if you're having fun or not, it's your problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    I always assume a survivor is a toxic POS unless proven otherwise.
    I'm not paranoid: according to statistics, most survivors either don't care about killers' fun or are actively
    making them upset.
    Therefore I mostly don't respect survivors.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never let the survivors go purely on principle.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never DC or give up, unless I'm playing against cheaters, bug-abusers or having IRL distractions.
  </p>
  <p>
    No mercy to TTVs, SWFs and wannabe 'comp' players.
    They make heavily survivor-sided game even more hard to play.
    I always bring Sacrificial Ward if I suspect you are one of THOSE.
  </p>
  <p>
    Expect 4min nap on the ground if you bring map offering, flashbangs, or saboteur.
    The same applies to so called Bully Squads.
    You delay my game, I delay yours.
  </p>
  <p>
    Expect meticulous movement if you do tbags, pointing, waving, standing still on purpose, Scene Partner or other
    disrespectful stuff.
    You disrespect me, I disrespect your time.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I managed to slug the whole team I won't pick you up to avoid 4% as well as antitunelling or wiggle perks. Feel
    free to DC.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you complain that you lost to a noob like me (especially on survivor sided map) - it means you are so bad, that
    even noobs can beat you. Get better, deal with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deboosting or smurfing 'comp' players, especially biowaste trying to generate content off new players (e.g.
    streamers / ticktockers e.t.c.) are the worst people in DBD community.
    You will always get report for Unsportsmanlike Conduct from me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've had a lot of games with (subtle) cheaters.
    If you meet certain requirements of mine, you WILL receive a report for cheating from me, even if there is no hard
    evidence of you cheating.
