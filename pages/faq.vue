  <p><b>U mad?</b> Don't play Solo Queue LMAO</p>

  <p><b>Mad about camping?</b> Trade with the hooked survivor once they are about to hit second stage, bring Reassurance
    + DO GENS</p>

  <p><b>Mad about tunelling?</b> Bring Decisive Strike / Off The Record / Dead Hard / Blood Rush, try altruistic plays
    such as blinding or sandbagging the killer, sabotaging hooks e.t.c. + DO GENS</p>

  <p><b>Mad about slugging?</b> Bring Unbreakable / Boon: Exponential / We Are Gonna Live Forever / Buckle Up / Medkit
    with a Syringe + DO GENS FOR ONCE???</p>

  <p><b>Mad about all of the above at 5 gens?</b> Why are you allowing me to do it? Why is there no gen pressure? WHY IS
    NOONE DOING GENS??? MAJOR SKILL ISSUE</p>

  <p><b>Mad about map offering?</b> Bring your own / Sacrificial Ward</p>

  <p><b>Mad about NOED?</b> Always expect M1 killer to have it</p>

  <p><b>Mad about Undetectable?</b> Try using Discord</p>

  <p><b>Mad about iri button?</b> Use T-L-s or other window-based loops</p>

  <p><b>Mad about legion?</b> 99% mending, run in different directions, don't group up, don't heal unless you need to
    unhook or counter Thanataphobia</p>

  <p><b>Mad about twins?</b> Always stay healthy, don't remove victor, use antislugging build</p>

  <p><b>Mad about trickster?</b> Always run to loops with high walls, crouch at loops with low walls, use strong map
    offerings, don't group up, NEVER UNHOOK IN TRICKSTERS FACE</p>

  <p><b>Mad about game somehow being killer sided?</b> Don't play solo Q. Bring map offerings. Use good builds.

      though hatch is considered a draw for your rating</a>, so you didn't win either.

    still win</a>.
    I don't care about BP, Mori-s, achievements and other bullshit.
    I don't care about 3k or 4k either, i just want to win.

  <p><b>You won against me and taunt me?</b> Congratulations, filthy children of Azarov, you did the thing. You ran from
    pallet to pallet into windows to pallet to window into pallet. It was very hard to win when the game plays itself,
    wasn't it?</p>
