At the start of the Trial, the [3 Generators]{.bhvr-yellow} located farthest from you are blocked by The Entity for [80]
{.bhvr-yellow}/[100]{.bhvr-green}/[120]{.bhvr-purple} seconds.

*Corrupt Intervention deactivates prematurely once the first Survivor is put into the Dying State*

> While the perk is active, survivors can only repair 4 generators that were closest to your spawn

> Generators near the spawns of survivors will almost certainly be blocked and they will have to run to the other half
> of the map, closer to you

> This will allow you to buy time to down the first survivor

> Even if you manage to down someone before 120s, the survivors will still spend time looking for a generator that can
> be repaired, so even in this case, the perk will be useful

> Great for killers who need to spend time preparing, such as Trapper, Hag, Singularity, etc.

> Great for stealth killers, because survivors will be forced to run to your half of the map

> Ideally, you should always have either Corrupt Intervention or [Lethal Persuer](/perk/lethal_persuer). It's better not
> to take both perks at the same time though

> The perk can be instantly disabled with the help of a meme
> build: [No Mither](/perk/no_mither) + [Plot Twist](/perk/plot_twist)
