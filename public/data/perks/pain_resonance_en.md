At the start of the Trial, [4 random Hooks]{.bhvr-yellow} are changed into Scourge Hooks:

* The auras of [Scourge Hooks]{.bhvr-white} are revealed to you in [white]{.bhvr-white}.

You start the Trial with [4 Tokens]{.bhvr-orange} on *Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance*.

Each time a Survivor is hooked on a [Scourge Hook]{.bhvr-white} for the first time, [1 Token]{.bhvr-red} is consumed and
the following effects apply:

* The Generator with the most Progression explodes and [instantly regresses]{.bhvr-white} by [10]{.bhvr-yellow}/[15]
  {.bhvr-green}/[20]{.bhvr-purple} % of its total Progression.
* Normal Generator Regression applies afterwards.
* All Survivors repairing that Generator will scream, but not reveal their location.

*Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance is disabled for the remainder of the Trial once all Tokens are consumed.*
